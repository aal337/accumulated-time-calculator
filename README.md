# accumulated-time-calculator
A tool that calculates the total time spent on a recurring activity, based on its duration and frequency over a specified period.

## How to use
1. [Open this link](https://aal337.github.io/accumulated-time-calculator/)
1.1. Alternatively, the demo link on the SoM page just leads to the calculator.
2. Input the duration of your activity, at which frequency you do it and over which total period of time.
3. Click the green "Calculate" button.
4. Enjoy your result.

## I don't understand.
If you spend 30 minutes a day learning Python, and you do this for half a year, you input 30 minutes for duration, 1 day for frequency (after "per"), and 6 months for the last one. If you do this only every other day, your frequency is 2 days.
